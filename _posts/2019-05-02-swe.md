title: What is Software Engineering

Lately I've been interested in what is software engineering, by likening it to aspects of other disciplines. This is primarily written within the context of this [blog post](https://lispcast.com/software-factory) as well as a general response to the initial question.

To lightly summarize, much of the post discusses various models of software engineering, their consequences on the production of software, and considers alternatives, notably Glenn Vanderburg’s talk in which he dives into misconceptions on what engineering in general is. There’s a point where Vanderburg breaks down the process of a traditional engineering discipline, in which architects(designers) design and produce a document or blueprint that builders(coders) follow to produce a final released product. He then shows a different model where it still begins with software architects, however, these architects design and produce source code (essentially still a document containing the product) which is handed off to builders (compliers, CI/CD pipelines), who then produce the released program seen by users. 

Vanderburg states that in the second software model, building and releasing is cheap (relative to the overall process) when compared to a traditional engineering (manufacturing or civil) model, and is something that should be taken advantage of. Which some companies do - they’re just called startups. Judging by the way they hire though, most companies seem to follow the assembly line model. 

**Bootcamps**

The rise of coding bootcamps isn't signaling demand for software engineers, but for software builders. A good analogy might be what a construction company is like to an architecture firm. So I’m imagining (disclaimer, I haven’t attended or dove into their curriculum) that a bootcamp crams years of language, framework, or ecosystem syntax knowledge at the expense of system knowledge\*, and when companies are hiring for someone who has 5 years in Framework X or 3 years with Language Y, they’re not looking for architects who can juggle the needs and uses of a system, they’re looking for syntax knowledge - essentially builders within an assembly line for software. The problem is that distinct, silo’d operations can be an effective way to produce the *same* result, but not necessarily a good result. The goodness comes from the initial design process, but from my experience, most companies separate the role of designer and implementor/programmer.

Why can't programmers design? It seems to me that the person closest to the code has the easiest time understanding its limitations, and the person closest to the problem has the best understanding of how might something solve that problem. Why then, are people playing a game of telephone from user to designer to developer? This could be systematic of our culture as a whole, where every contributing member of society seems to need a well defined and a clear public facing role. Also, it's very easy to assume that if it's so hard to hire for just a single discipline, it must be at least twice as hard to hire someone skilled in multiple disciplines. I propose that it's simpler than one might think - just evaluate candidates by their portfolio.

**Software can have style**

What makes a portfolio the de facto way of getting to know a candidate? In engineering, as well as in art, there are very few cases where isolated problems can be solved without considering the system as a whole. Take painting a view of Manhattan from the shores of North Brooklyn. The system, or painting, can be broken into smaller problems - how to paint the waves of the Hudson lapping against the pier, cargo ships and ferries, and One World Trade, but in solving these subproblems, the system (its audience, its style) must be considered. Similar to how a Cubist would demonstrate ‘I wanted the abandonment of a single viewpoint’ throughout a painting, a software engineer can make a stylistic choice to prioritize usability throughout an application. Why then, are many standard tech hiring practices evaluating on subproblems rather than systems? For example, Google's interview involves an hour "coding" on a Google Doc, with expectations of writing syntactically correct code. 

I think it’s an identity crisis issue. There’s lots of thoughts on how software engineering is an art, a science, a craft, but the gist of Vanderburg’s talk is that it’s its own young discipline that doesn’t need to mirror practices and processes found in other engineering disciplines, but should readily expand upon them when necessary. I’ll end with Vanderburg’s final quote on what he believes software engineering is -

>“the science and art of designing and making, with economy and elegance, […] systems so that they can readily adapt to the situations to which they are subjected”. 


\*It's also not a guarantee that a degree provides system knowledge
