When is something done? 

I've been on hiatus from posting, but not writing - there are thoughts that I don't feel like are polished enough to put up on this site, or in other words, to show to nobody. For work, I've been keeping a daily log of my TODO (which is usually also yesterday's have done), and the act of getting things down refocuses me enough to get those tasks done. As far as blog posts go, I need to be similarly disciplined in the act of writing and posting, even if the content I'm posting isn't truly done yet - and the sense that unrefined posts are somehow cluttering or littering the site is only in my head - I'd prefer an honest view. Check the commit histories for updates. Let's go.
