title: Shutdowns
---

The marker for how ingrained a service or company is within society is its usage in language. I’m sure this is not a new idea, but this seems to be more pervasive now than ever, and the benchmark for what a “unicorn” aspires to be. Terms that have been replaced with company names include `search` for `google`, `watch TV` for `Netflix`, `call a cab` for `uber` or `Lyft` (that space still seems highly contentious although there seem to be more pop references to uber), and `sharing` has become a mosaic of companies - `tweeting`, `’gramming`, `snap chatting`. 

Another, perhaps better indicator is, what happens when the service a company provides shuts down? As of 2/6/2019, the US government is a nebulous state of shutdown - frankly, I don’t know and it has zero effect on my day to day life. However, if google were to shutdown all of its services - including Maps, Mail, Calendar, basically anything that’s not Google+ (a recent email notified users of its April death and nobody blinked), there’d be massive disruption across many different sectors. Of course, google would probably be liable for it’s G Suite service outages, but for the purely free services it provides - public reliance on a single non government entity to provide these things has never been greater. 

Stop and consider - do other companies (read: tech giants) pass this test in the same way google has?
