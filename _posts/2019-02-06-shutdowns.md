title: Shutdowns

A rising indicator for how ingrained a service or company is within society could be its usage in language, otherwise known as [mind share]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_share"). I’m sure this is not a new idea, but it seems to be the mark for modern successful companies - aka "unicorns", with terms that include `search` -> `google`, `watch TV` -> `Netflix`, `call a cab` -> `uber` or `Lyft` (no clear winner as of now), `transfer money` -> `Venmo`, and so on. If we take a look at public facing company name trends over time, I imagine the length has decreased (or more precisely, the syllable count) and so 'potential for increased mind share' has increased.

Still, the inevitability of a language permeated with company names - essentially natural advertisements, is a not a new concept; Zipper, Escalator, and Kleenex are all registered trademarks that have wormed their way into language and now form a class of ["generic trademarks"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generic_trademark). The downside of genericizing is (at least in the US and UK) losing trademark protection, which might appear in the form of a slight short term blip in sales or whatever, but the clear win is that a company has *defined a new class of products*. Humans will, now and until the forseeable future, require search engines - whether from google, or bing or whatever. If a product has made it's way into general everyday language, then it has a market. 


Another, perhaps better indicator is, what happens when the service a company provides shuts down? As of 2/6/2019, the US government is in a nebulous state of shutdown - frankly, I'm unclear and it has zero effect on my day to day life (anectdotal I know). However, if google were to shutdown all of its services - including Maps, Mail, Calendar, basically anything that’s not Google+ (a recent email notified users of its April death and nobody blinked), there would likely be disruption across many different sectors. Of course, google would probably be liable for its G Suite service outages, but for the purely free services it provides - public reliance on a single non government entity to provide these things has never been greater. 

Something to consider - do other companies (read: tech giants) pass this test in the same way google has?
