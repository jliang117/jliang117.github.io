## Traveling and times of emotional rawness

### Some thoughts after working remotely for the past two years:

Life is infinitely more flexible.
Flexibility offers dangerous possibility - to slack, to wander, to do some things completely differently. Is it possible to devote for the full duration of supposed working hours (40)? Yes, but it absolutely requires a full schedule, and usually most work (programming and generally generative/creative work) doesn’t necessarily require the full forty hours.

I prefer flexibility, and it’s freedom to spend unnecessary hours has privileged me to have lived multiple lifetimes within the past year. While the experiences have been incredible, the feeling is that fulfillment comes not from a single one, but the range of them encompassing the entire journey, which at it's core is simply to see where the world takes me. 

### Things I picked up

I've started taking voice notes or samples throughout the time.
Talking to oneself isn’t seen as crazy at this point, tt’s good practice for conversation and storytelling. I was always awful at capturing the emotions of a moment, at revealing the precise window into a state of the world - the constant passage of time makes the perfect word forever just out of reach, and the struggle to find it continually ruins the subsequent description. Why does this happen? If my thoughts were to be immediately recorded, without any lapse between thinking and writing, then maybe I could be clearer? The belief that the initial vision was perfect with lesser attempts during refining and reshaping seems so pure, yet totally untrue for most crafts. It's really because time changes, time fractures the paths available for thoughts to take, and often the first thought is the most striking. It's only copies and imitations that appear afterwards. 

Keeping up with disciplined writing time or requirements was always hard for me (essays in school usually had a word or page requirement, one that I navigated with spacing, font, margin and sizing tricks) and so speaking makes it a bit easier - plus redoing an audio draft feels disingenuous; it's just better to start a new idea instead. 

Some of the most interesting ones I’ll upload and post, there’s some lovely stories told by friends I’ve made, sounds of the London Underground, and contemplative walks. 

### What I loved

The mundane was done away with - every sense seemed to open up more to the world, even as the feeling of losing my senses to constant decay remained.
