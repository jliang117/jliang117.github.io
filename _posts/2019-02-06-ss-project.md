I check out NYC samples sales occasionally - a good resource has been [The Choosy Beggar](http://thechoosybeggar.com).

Planning out the route was much easier when I could visualize all the pins on one map 

So the idea was to scrape the site for sales, generate json map pins, and place them on a static map:
