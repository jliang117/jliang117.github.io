Mirror mirror on the wall, show me the best of them all. 

Whenever I'm asked if I have an Instagram, I initially found it hard to reply with something concrete - and I usually just go with "I do, but I don’t”. What does that even mean?! Not sure, but I’d like to explain here. For myself, Instagram is best used as a sort of digital photo book - it's the curated highlights of all the moments I've found and would like to remember, and I try to limit sharing to only people I meet with in person. To do this, I follow no one, and nobody follows me, and that gives control over what the platform shows me.

This kind of usage is intended to limit the weird one way (diode-like) form of Instagramming (or other types of social media) that seems pervasive in society today, where it’s just used to get a quick hit of dopamine. There have been plenty of studies done on the effects of excessive social media usage[\*](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_vis=0&q=excessive++%22social+media%22++use&hl=en&as_sdt=0,33), but just even anecdotally, I find that excessive updates on the best accomplishments and successes of others to be a source of envy, disappointment, and insecurity. The key here is excessive - the world is becoming ever more intertwined, and that’s not going to slow down (and there’s really no reason to, people *want* to talk and see what friends or loved ones are up to), it’s just that there has to be a limit.

Like I alluded to earlier, I’ve been thinking about social media more and more as a magic spell, so maybe we can turn to popular thoughts and quotes about magic in literature for insights - such as this thought in the Witcher series:

>*It is Art, Chaos, and Science: a blessing, a curse, and progress. It all depends on who calls upon it, and for what purpose.*

Magic is seen as a tool, with a similar bipartisan take on morality, and that the wielder or user is the ultimate determinant of its effects. As with most tools (and magic), there are guidelines (and ministries) created to regulate and prevent misuse. Maybe if we treat instagram, Facebook, and other social media platforms as the magic spell of scrying (which is surprisingly similar - [here's a definition, kinda](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Scrying#content)), then a natural set of rules may follow: 

1. Don't scry on people you don't know. (Edit - this could be better amended as "Be cautious of insights gained from scrying on people you don't know.", which is similar to #2.)
2. Some people know that they're being watched, and so will show you what they want you to see.
3. Scrying for more than a few hours at a time may lead to blindness and a disjointed sense of reality. 
 
The last one was sorta kidding, but it really feels like after a long session of scrolling downwards, a sort of mind rot takes over - it’s just so easy and never ending and hard to stop, you never know what might come next, after all. 

As a kid, I was never too impressed with magic. I’m still not, but now even more so, because we have entire worlds in our pockets. What’s a magic mirror to Instagram, what’s a magic 8 ball to Twitter? Maybe it’d be interesting to see what new insights can be found if we treat some technologies as magic, or vice versa, try and implement magic spells using technology.
