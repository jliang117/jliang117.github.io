What is this generation working on?

With the dot com and internet boom, a lot of services and standout startups solved connectivity and linkage issues. The roads between different vertices weren't formed yet, so the pioneers built the social networks, the content streaming services (Spotify, Netflix, etc.), the blogs - the linkage and instant dissemination of culture to the masses. There's a feeling that these roads are fully fleshed (or at least mapped) out, and new spokes on the hub of the internet might have a hard time finding any traction (see clubhouse, possibly nexdoor?) without building over an existing niche (tiktok over vine).

What happens when the roads are all built? One idea might be augmentation - the addition of a fast lane, or in tech's case, an AI augmented lane. Now when we look for funny memes using a GIF keyboard, searching funny autocomplete the *current* idea of funny, without any additional research from the person telling the joke. A more concrete example would be me searching "waiting" and finding (unknown to me) the meme of Pablo Escobar on a swing meme.

Recent access to GPT-3 has been coloring my thoughts, and searching for ideas to use it in immediately leads to things AI could *augment*. For example, what about autocompleting a phrase of music, or lyrics/lines in a poem, or the rest of a painting? The frontier currently lies in AI generation but human *curation*, and an interesting but niche application of it may be AI as a muse.

## Generalizing

It's likely still the case that AI augmenting a bad painter will still result in a bad painting, and same with most creative outliets, but maybe the real win is to get people inspired and collaborating with this sense of "other" that an AI can provide. 

*A vision hits me*

The year 2079. Everyone is under some form of UBI with sufficient financial security.

Art, creativity, and human connection is reaching grand heights with everyone having their own personal augmented AI muse. Everyone is able to fully and totally express themselves through whatever passion they decide to persue.

Well the first part was def a pipe dream but maybe not the second? Guess I'll wait for it.
