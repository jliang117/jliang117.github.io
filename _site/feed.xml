        <title>Extracting</title>
        <description>
          
          I did fast.ai lesson 2 which involved building your own classifier using images from the internet, and was interested in breaking down how exactly they downloaded images from a google image search (gonna assume it’ll be useful later). They had you perform a search, then scroll enough to load a...

        <title>When are you finished?</title>
        <description>
          
          When is something done? I’ve been on hiatus from posting, but not writing - there are thoughts that I don’t feel like are polished enough to put up on this site, or in other words, to show to nobody. For work, I’ve been keeping a daily log of my TODO...

        <title>Autobattlers</title>
        <description>
          
          A whole new genre has swept the gaming community, and I’d like to take some time here to discuss what makes this autobattler thing so fun, the current contenders vying for this market, and what the future looks like for each. The race to build the next autochess is super...

        <title>What is Software Engineering</title>
        <description>
          
          I’ve lately been trying to clarify what software engineering is. It’s initially logical to evoke and take ideas from other engineering disciplines, where maybe the same question of is it an art, a science, or a craft still exists. But in diving a bit deeper, the lines are fairly blurred,...

        <title>Instagram's Magic Spell</title>
        <description>
          
          Mirror mirror on the wall, show me the best of them all. Whenever I’m asked if I’m on Instagram, I find it hard to reply with something concrete - so I usually go with “I do, but I don’t”. What does that even mean?! Not sure, but I’d like to...

        <title>Design Course Debrief</title>
        <description>
          
          Beginning in January, I was involved in taking an introductory Human-Centered Design course, provided by +Acumen and IDEO.org. Going into it, I had a belief that design is central to many creative processes, and was looking to dive a bit more in-depth into the whole process. My only previous experience...

        <title>Résumés</title>
        <description>
          
          Origins (and future) of the Résumé While applying for jobs recently, I’ve been spending lots of time writing and rewriting résumés but it’s hard to evaluate if there’s even much of a payoff for that time invested, and the feeling that this short, almost meaningless document is the only thing...

        <title>Sample Sales</title>
        <description>
          
          I check out NYC samples sales occasionally - a good resource has been The Choosy Beggar. I had a problem with the way the site separated each sale post and their respective maps, meaning I’d go through multiple clicks back and forth to view each location, and couldn’t plan my...

        <title>Shutdowns</title>
        <description>
          
          A rising indicator for how ingrained a service or company is within society could be its usage in language, otherwise known as mind share. I’m sure this is not a new idea, but it seems to be the mark for modern successful companies - aka “unicorns”, with terms that include...
